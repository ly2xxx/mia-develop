## 💡 Top Tips for Beginners

- Use MAT, STEP, PAT for building skills
- Treat TMUA papers as "sacred" final practice

### 2. Mistakes Are Gold

- Don't just mark wrong answers and move on
- Understand the underlying concept

### 3. Speed Builds Gradually
- Week 1-4: Focus on accuracy (no time pressure)
- Week 5-8: Gradual time pressure (5 min/question)
- Week 9+: Strict timing (3.75 min/question)

### 4. Anki Is Your Best Friend
- Review EVERY DAY (even just 10 minutes)

- Quality > Quantity

### 5. Rest Is Part of Training
- One full rest day per week
- Sleep 8 hours during prep
- Burnout helps nobody!

## 🆘 When You Feel Stuck

### Feeling overwhelmed?
**Action:** Focus on ONE resource at a time. Just MAT this week. Nothing else.

### Not improving?
**Action:** Review your review process. Are you just marking answers or truly understanding?

### Too slow?
**Action:** Practice mental math daily. Learn shortcut methods. Use Anki for formula recall.

### Forgetting everything?
**Action:** Anki intervals might be too long. Review more frequently initially.

### Can't stay motivated?
**Action:** Remember WHY you're doing this. Cambridge/Imperial awaits! 🎓
