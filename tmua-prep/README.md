## 🧠 Anki Flashcard System

### Setup
1. Download Anki: https://apps.ankiweb.net/
2. Create deck: "TMUA Preparation 2026"
3. Sub-decks for each resource category

### Card Creation Strategy
**When to create a card:**
- Got a question wrong
- Solved inefficiently (took too long)
- Found a clever trick/shortcut
- New problem type encountered

**Card format:**
- **Front:** Problem statement (simplified) + key insight needed
- **Back:** Fastest solution method + why it works + common pitfalls

**Example card:**
```
FRONT: 
Quadratic inequality: x² - 5x + 6 < 0
Key insight: ?

BACK:
1. Factorize: (x-2)(x-3) < 0
2. Roots: x = 2, 3
3. Sketch parabola (opens upward)
4. Solution: 2 < x < 3 (between roots)
⚠️ Common mistake: Forgetting to check which way parabola opens
```

## 🎓 Study Tips from 9.0 Scorer

### Mental Approach
1. **Understand > Memorize:** But use Anki to reinforce understanding
2. **Speed matters:** You need autopilot responses to familiar patterns
3. **70% recognition target:** If you've seen it before, you should solve it quickly
4. **Later questions harder:** Save time on early Qs to tackle difficult ones

### Exam Technique
1. **No negative marking:** Guess if stuck (but educated guess preferred)
2. **Time per question:** ~3.75 minutes average
3. **Flag and return:** Don't get stuck on one question
4. **Check arithmetic:** Silly mistakes cost marks

### Common Pitfalls
- Rushing through "easy" questions and making careless errors
- Spending too long on one hard question
- Not attempting all questions
- Forgetting to use all answer options (elimination strategy)
